    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Solution Design Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to tried different models and using different data sets.\n",
    "The models that I have tried for this project:\n",
    "1. Simple Neural Networks. The resulting model is bad. The car just drives around in counter clockwise direction.  \n",
    "2. LeNet, as described in the lecture. The car failed to drive by itself for a full lap.  \n",
    "3. Nvidia model, without dropouts. Good result. The car was able to drive autonomously on track for hours with the resulting model.  \n",
    "4. Nvidia model, with dropouts. Better generic result. The car was able to drive autonomously on track for hours with the resulting model. It was not as smooth as the resulting model from \\#3, but with more parameter tuning this might be a more generalized model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Final Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model architecture is the Nvidia model as explained in the lecture.  The model reference can be found here:\n",
    "https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/  \n",
    "In addition to the original model, I have added Dropout layers with keep probability of 0.5 on all fully connected layers.  \n",
    "The model consists of 5 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers.  \n",
    "Convolutional Layer 1: Filter: 24 x (5 x 5), Stride: 2 x 2, RELU activation  \n",
    "Convolutional Layer 2: Filter: 36 x (5 x 5), Stride: 2 x 2, RELU activation  \n",
    "Convolutional Layer 3: Filter: 48 x (5 x 5), Stride: 2 x 2, RELU activation  \n",
    "Convolutional Layer 4: Filter: 64 x (3 x 3), Stride: 1 x 1, RELU activation  \n",
    "Convolutional Layer 5: Filter: 64 x (3 x 3), Stride: 1 x 1, RELU activation  \n",
    "Fully Connected Layer 1: Output 100 neurons with Dropout layer (keep probability: 0.5)  \n",
    "Fully Connected Layer 2: Output  50 neurons with Dropout layer (keep probability: 0.5)  \n",

    "#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture good driving behavior, I collected different sets of data using the provided simulator.  \n",
    "I collected the data by doing smooth center lane driving clockwise and counter clockwise, utilizing multiple cameras with left and right steering angle correction of +/- 0.2.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Here is an example image of center lane driving:\n",

    "\n",
    "Left Camera:\n",

    "\n",
    "Right Camera:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](./images/right_cam.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I also crop the top and bottom section of the image to remove unnecessary artifacts like tree, clouds, water, etc, that might complicate the learning process.  \n",
    "The cropped image looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](./images/center_cam_cropped.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Data augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles to reduce left turn bias, because more data is collected driving in counter clockwise direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is an image that has been flipped:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](./images/center_cam.png)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Flipped:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](./images/center_cam_flipped.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting data is also heavily bias towards data with steering angle falls between -0.1 and 0.0. \n",
    "Here is the histogram of the original data:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](images/histogram_original_data.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before training the model, I discard about 75% of this data to reduce the low angle bias.\n",
    "Here is the histogram of the reduced data:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](./images/histogram_reduced_straight_angle.png)\n",

    "The training/evaluation set split is 80%/20%\n",
